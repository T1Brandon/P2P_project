'''
A P2P client
It provides the following functions:
- Register the content file to the index server (R)
- Contact the index server to search for a content file (D) 
    - Contact the peer to download the file
    - Register the content file to the index server
- De-register a content file (T)
- List the local registered content files (L)
- List the on-line registered content files (O)

Here we config the server capability of the peers. As a server we need to specify ip address and ports. Since all the 
peers are inside the local network (IP=127.0.0.1), we need to use unique port numbers for each peers so they can
bind socket successfully. This can be done by generating random numbers and using try/except command to bind a socket.
Withing multiple attempt we can be sure that peer would eventually bind a socket with random port number. Here I do not
use this approach. Instead I asked the user to enter a port number manually. During the test, for each of the peers,
you will need to enter different port numbers for different peers. 
The '' for IP address means our server is listening to all IPs,
you can change it to socket.hostname instead like before.
